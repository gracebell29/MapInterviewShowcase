        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This project was developed for an Anthropology class at UNC Chapel Hill. These maps were designed to showcase well water contamination in North Carolina and the geographic relationship between the contaminants and hazardous waste site locations. 
        First, private well sites in NC and hazardous waste sites were mapped.
        From there, the average level of dangerous contaminants within tested well water throughout the state was also mapped. 
        These contaminants include Arsenic and Lead, as well as pH levels. These levels are as of 2010 records and may vary today.    </p>
